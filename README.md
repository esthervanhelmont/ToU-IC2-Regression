# ToU-IC2-Regression

# **Machine Learning Regression for proactive attack pattern detection in IoT networks**

By **predicting** `flow_duration` **from basic network telemetry** in real-time IoT traffic, we can spot unusual resource use early and surface potential attack patterns before they escalate. This enables proactive capacity planning *(autoscaling, QoS tuning)* and faster security response, reducing downtime and operating costs while keeping connected devices reliable.

In line with **SDG 9 *(Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure)*** and **SDG 16 *(Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions)***, this approach strengthens digital infrastructure and improves cyber-resilience for services that increasingly depend on IoT.

**Impact:** Securing IoT networks helps keep critical infrastructure - such as smart cities, healthcare, and energy systems - safe and reliable. **Concretely,** this means hospital sensor networks remain stable and smart city street lighting is protected from attack-driven disruptions.
